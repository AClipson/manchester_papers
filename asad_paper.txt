# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa.

Sustainable energy is vital for future decarbonisation of our energy networks and carbon emissions reduction 

# Simulations
we simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are carried away from the source region.

#Methodology
We compared our results with that those in reference.


#Figures
Attached you may find figures.
