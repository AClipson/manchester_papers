# Title
Measurement - model comparison of biomass burning aerosol aging over West Africa

# Abstract
Abstracts are hard to write. That's why we do it last.

# Introduction section
We present measurements of BBOA over West Africa.
The measurements were made using an AMS, as described in Bloggs et al 2004.
Smith et al have made extensive measurements in this region before,
but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

# Simulations
We simulate the evolution of BBOA over W Africa, using John's marvellous model.

# Methodology
We compared simulations from model Y (Smith et al, 2005) with our measurements.

# Results
Our simulations and measurements indicate particle growth is dominated by coagulation.

# Conclusions
We have made fantastic insight into the BBOA aging process.
Nonetheless, questions remain unanswered, so we should get some more funding.

# Figures
Add figures here. It's a draft.

# Acknowledgements
We would like to thank our EU funding body.
